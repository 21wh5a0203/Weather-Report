#Weather-Report
we created a weather app using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code.

In this weather app, you can get the weather details of a particular city by entering the city name .If you entered an invalid city name then there is shown an error message.

Youâ€™ll get many weather details in this app like Local Time, Temperature in Celsius , Wind Speed, Location, feels like, and Humidity.

There is all the HTML code for the weather app. We are using HTML forms to collect location data from the users. According to the location received from user input, we will display the weather information inside the <main> element.
